## 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on end-to-end data analysis and machine learning to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models from real-world restaurant data. The goal is not just to train models, but to understand the data deeply, uncover patterns, and translate analytical findings into actionable business insights.

The workflow follows a structured data science approach — starting from dataset understanding and cleaning, moving through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and finally applying machine learning models with proper evaluation and tuning.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to analyze Zomato restaurant data to identify the key factors influencing customer ratings and reviews. Based on these insights, machine learning models are built to predict restaurant ratings using features such as pricing, cuisine type, location, and customer engagement.

---

## 🧩 Dataset Understanding

The dataset includes restaurant metadata and customer reviews, covering:
- Restaurant details (name, cuisine, cost, location)
- Customer ratings and reviews
- Pricing and engagement information

Initial analysis was performed to understand data structure, data types, missing values, and inconsistencies.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps included:
- Handling missing values using appropriate imputation techniques
- Converting cost and rating columns into numeric formats
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant records
- Standardizing text fields (lowercasing, trimming, normalization)
- Cleaning and preprocessing review text for NLP tasks

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed using the **UBM rule**:
- **Univariate Analysis** to study individual feature distributions  
- **Bivariate Analysis** to explore relationships between two variables  
- **Multivariate Analysis** to analyze interactions among multiple features  

More than **15 meaningful visualizations** were created, including:
- Bar charts and count plots  
- Box plots and histograms  
- Scatter plots and correlation heatmaps  

Each visualization was selected to answer a specific business or analytical question and was
